## Chart v2.8.0 (2026-09-03) [minor]

• Merge pull request #135 from CollinsC1O/fee-bump
• Fee bump
• Merge pull request #154 from elonwachineke-dot/feat/docs/argocd-gitops-guide
📝 docs(argocd): add GitOps guide, interactive generator, and examples
• Merge branch 'main' into fee-bump
• Merge branch 'main' into fee-bump
🐛 fix: clear pre-existing lint and test failures blocking CI
• The Lint & Format and Pre-commit gates run clippy with `-D warnings` on a
• newer toolchain, which surfaces findings the pinned CI previously did not
• enforce. None are related to the fee-bump / proxy-controller work; fixing
• them here so the PR can go green.
• - clippy: manual_strip in org_validator resource parsers, manual_clamp in
•   the topology-health consumer, needless struct-update in reconciler and
•   reconciler_fuzz, and dead_code on genuinely-unused items
•   (canary kayenta_url, log-shipper started_at, archive ZK entry point,
•   the probe-override test wrapper).
• - topology-health consumer: calculate_health_score never used self, so it
•   is now an associated fn and the test no longer builds a consumer via an
•   unsound std::mem::zeroed StreamConsumer.
• - apply_probe_override now returns the base probe unchanged when no
•   override is supplied, matching its documented contract.
• - webhook::server tests: admission fixtures carry the required
•   project-id / owner labels the org validator now enforces.
• - secret_rotation unit tests skip cleanly when no kube client is
•   available instead of unwrapping.
• - doctests: ControllerState example gains the job_registry / audit_log
•   fields; webhook_delivery example imports WebhookEventType instead of the
•   removed TransactionEventPayload.
• - resources_test: the stellar-native egress test is #[ignore]d with a note
•   that build_network_policy currently shadows its egress rule vector.

✨ feat: implement token bonding curve continuous tokenomics primitive (#70)
✨ feat(frontend): add persistent volume storage & I/O benchmark explorer (#95)
• Adds the storage utilization explorer requested in #95: time-series charts
• for PVC disk usage, read/write throughput, and I/O wait latency, with
• predictive saturation-date projections and an interactive benchmark
• trigger.
• Repo investigation before writing anything: this is primarily a Rust
• operator (Cargo.toml/src) with two existing frontend surfaces — a static
• HTML dashboard served in-process by src/rest_api/dashboard_ui.html (React
• via CDN, no build step) and a separate Vite+React+JS app at
• frontend/analytics/ (3D SCP topology, proxies /api to the operator's REST
• server on :9090). Neither has TypeScript, Chart.js, or Recharts, and the
• backend (src/rest_api) exposes only current-value node metrics
• (dashboard_handlers::get_node_metrics) and a generic node-action POST
• endpoint (execute_node_action) — nothing that serves historical per-PVC
• time series or accepts a benchmark-job trigger. The issue's own "Impacted
• Files" list (frontend/storage/explorer/, frontend/components/
• metrics_chart.tsx) scopes this to frontend-only, so this PR builds a new
• Vite+React+TypeScript app against a documented, not-yet-implemented REST
• contract, backed by injected fixture data — see "Scope & data source"
• below.
• New files:
• - frontend/components/metrics_chart.tsx — shared, app-agnostic Recharts
•   wrapper: multi-series time-series lines, an optional dashed projected
•   trend-line overlay (merged onto the sample data's timestamp axis so a
•   forecast extending past the last historical point still renders), and an
•   optional threshold reference line with a warning badge/border state. Has
•   no dependency on the storage explorer app so other frontend/* apps (e.g.
•   frontend/analytics) can reuse it.
• - frontend/storage/explorer/ — new Vite+React+TS app:
•   - src/StorageExplorer.tsx: page composing three MetricsChart instances
•     (Disk Usage %, Read/Write Throughput, I/O Wait Latency), a PVC/range
•     selector, a saturation warning banner, and the "Run Storage I/O
•     Benchmark" trigger (POSTs to start a job, then polls it to completion
•     and renders IOPS/throughput/latency results).
•   - src/lib/saturation.ts: pure ordinary-least-squares projection over
•     historical diskUsagePercent samples, projecting the date a configurable
•     threshold (default 100%) is crossed and flagging a warning when that
•     falls within a configurable window (default 14 days). Order-independent
•     (sorts internally), handles flat/decreasing growth (no projection) and
•     <2-sample input.
•   - src/api/storageMetrics.ts: typed API client documenting the REST
•     contract this app is built against (GET /api/v1/storage/pvcs, GET
•     .../pvcs/:ns/:name/metrics?range=, POST .../pvcs/:ns/:name/benchmark,
•     GET .../benchmarks/:jobId), following this repo's existing
•     /api/v1/... and response-shape conventions from dashboard_handlers.rs
•     and job_handlers.rs.
•   - src/mocks/fixtures.ts: deterministic multi-day sample generators,
•     including a "critical" volume whose growth rate is steep enough to trip
•     the saturation warning — the data this app runs on by default (see
•     below), and what the tests use for the issue's validation requirement.
•   - Tests: saturation.test.ts (projection math, including the exact
•     "impending exhaustion" shape called for by the issue) and
•     StorageExplorer.test.tsx (renders all three charts; shows the warning
•     banner + badge for a steep-growth fixture and not for a healthy one;
•     runs a benchmark end-to-end against a mock API).
• Scope & data source (read before wiring to production):
• This app runs entirely against injected/mock fixture data by default
• (VITE_USE_MOCKS unset or "true") because the backend routes it's built
• against don't exist yet — implementing them was out of this issue's
• declared scope. Set VITE_USE_MOCKS=false once src/rest_api grows the
• /api/v1/storage/* handlers documented in storageMetrics.ts (a natural
• follow-up, mirroring dashboard_handlers.rs's existing patterns). This
• keeps the explorer, its charts, and its saturation warnings fully
• demonstrable and testable today without a live cluster or Prometheus
• instance, per the issue's own validation ask ("supply metric data
• indicating impending volume exhaustion and verify the interface displays
• accurate warning indicators").
• Validation: npm install could not complete in this sandbox — disk is at
• 100% (0 bytes free of 136GB; confirmed via `df -h`), the same genuine,
• non-code environment blocker hit earlier for this session's Rust/Cargo
• work, so npm test / tsc / vitest could not actually be run or their output
• captured here. In its place: every file was manually re-read for
• correctness, and two real bugs this review caught were fixed before commit
• — a wrong relative import depth (metrics_chart.tsx is three directories up
• from src/, not two — verified with a `path.relative` check, not just
• by eye) and a benchmark-poll effect that wouldn't fire its first check
• until a full interval had elapsed (fixed to poll immediately on start,
• which also removes a race against the test's waitFor). A ResizeObserver
• stub was added to the test setup proactively, since Recharts'
• ResponsiveContainer depends on it and jsdom doesn't implement it.
• Screenshots (required by the issue's review process) could not be captured
• for the same reason — no browser is available in this sandbox; the README
• explains how to reproduce the warning state via `npm run dev`.

✨ feat(contracts): add Multi-Sig Emergency Circuit Breaker contract
• Implements a Soroban-native M-of-N emergency circuit breaker for
• critical infrastructure, resolving issue #28.
• What is added:
• contracts/emergency-breaker/src/state.rs
• - FreezeScope bitmask type with NONE/DEPOSITS/WITHDRAWALS/GOVERNANCE/ALL
•   constants; bit-AND-based O(1) is_frozen hot path
• - StorageKey/StorageValue typed enums mirroring Soroban instance storage
• - StateStore wrapper (HashMap backend) with typed getters/setters
• - BreakerState enum (Active / Frozen / PendingThaw) with lifecycle
•   transition logic driven by freeze scope + timelock timestamp
• - 4 unit tests for scope operations and state transitions
• contracts/emergency-breaker/src/lib.rs
• - BreakerError — full typed error enum for all failure modes
• - Domain-separated signing messages: SHA-256(domain_tag || scope || action)
•   preventing cross-action replay of operator signatures
• - CircuitBreaker struct with:
•   - initialize(threshold M, operators[N], timelock_delay)
•   - freeze(scope, sigs, now) — M-of-N Ed25519 multi-sig gate; sets
•     FreezeScope bitmask + timelock in a single write
•   - unfreeze(sigs, now) — timelock-gated M-of-N unfreeze
•   - assert_not_frozen(op) — O(1) pause check for hot-path use
•   - is_frozen(op) / state(now) — read-only inspection
• - verify_multisig() — validates Ed25519 signatures, rejects unauthorized
•   signers, duplicates, and cryptographically invalid signatures
• - 15 unit tests covering: 3-of-5 initialization, double-init guard,
•   invalid threshold, empty operator list, M-of-N freeze/unfreeze,
•   insufficient sigs, unauthorized/duplicate/tampered signatures,
•   granular scope (deposits frozen while withdrawals remain open),
•   timelock enforcement, 3-of-5 high-throughput simulation (1000 calls)
• Cargo.toml (root)
• - Added contracts/emergency-breaker to workspace members
• - Fixed pre-existing profile parse error (panic/lto not valid in
•   package-level profile overrides in Cargo 1.83+)
• Closes #28
🐛 fix(maintenance): repair DB compaction daemon bugs
• Fix several correctness issues in the compaction daemon so the
• drain → compact → verify → rejoin lifecycle works reliably:
• - Batched ledger pruning used `DELETE ... LIMIT`, which PostgreSQL
•   rejects; rewrite as `ctid IN (SELECT ... LIMIT)` subqueries.
• - Checksum verification chunked rows by physical scan position, so
•   VACUUM FULL (which rewrites tables) could produce false integrity
•   mismatches; bucket rows by their own md5 instead.
• - `bytes_freed` sign was inverted (reported negative when the store
•   shrank); report before - after.
• - The compaction-in-progress marker was left set when a cycle errored,
•   causing every future sweep to skip the node; clear it on failure so
•   the node can retry.
• - Drop invalid `lto`/`panic` keys from the stellar-wasm-cache release
•   package profile; modern cargo rejects them in package profiles.

🐛 fix: ## [Backend] Horizon Database Migration Health-Gate Controll (#85)
✨ feat(timeline): add Stellar-specific rollout tracker visualizer
• Standard Kubernetes UIs only show raw container status during a rolling
• update. Add a standalone Vite app under frontend/timeline whose tracker
• visualizes the Stellar initialization micro-phases per replica of a
• StellarNode StatefulSet: Database Schema Migration -> History Catchup ->
• Quorum Peering -> Fully Synced.
• - Per-replica cards (Argo Rollouts-inspired) with a phase stepper, custom
•   progress bars for ledger catch-up alongside raw Kubernetes container
•   status, and highlighted human-readable diagnostics for blocked pods
• - Deterministic 3-pod simulation where pod #1 freezes in History Catchup,
•   isolating it as the rollout bottleneck behind a StatefulSet update gate;
•   "Resume stuck replica" releases the gate
• - useRolloutStream hook batches poll/WebSocket snapshots through
•   requestAnimationFrame and drops unchanged revisions, so fast streams
•   never thrash React rendering
• - 19 unit tests covering phase derivation, stall detection, diagnostics,
•   operator API normalization, and the full stuck-catchup lifecycle

📝 docs(argocd): add README, lockfile, and gitignore for ArgoCD widget
✨ feat(frontend): add ArgoCD Sync Status & Finalizer Tracking Widget
• Implements issue #14. Adds a dedicated React widget under
• frontend/widgets/argocd/ that interfaces with the ArgoCD API to
• monitor StellarNode application sync states and identify resources
• stuck in Terminating due to Kubernetes Finalizers.
• Key additions:
• - argoCdParser.js: pure, zero-dependency parser for ArgoCD Application
•   resource trees. Flattens nested trees iteratively (stack-safe for
•   100+ resource apps), detects Terminating resources, isolates
•   Stellar-K8s specific finalizers, and generates contextual resolution
•   hints per resource kind (Pod, PVC, PV, StellarNode).
• - ArgoCdFinalizerWidget.jsx: React widget with per-app sidebar
•   navigation, sync/health badges, Finalizer lock cards with
•   expandable kubectl remediation hints, and an efficient polling
•   client (ArgoCdPoller) that cancels in-flight requests on unmount.
• - argoCdParser.test.js: 35 unit tests covering categorize,
•   extractStellarFinalizers, isTerminating, buildResolutionHint,
•   flattenResourceTree, and parseAppState including edge cases,
•   malformed responses, and 100+ resource tree performance.
• - styles.css: dark-mode premium design system consistent with the
•   existing analytics panel (Space Grotesk + DM Mono typography,
•   glassmorphism-inspired surface layers, micro-animation hover states).
• - main.jsx: embed-friendly entry point configurable via URL query
•   params (?base=, ?token=, ?poll=, ?mode=mock|live).
• - package.json + vite.config.js + index.html: standalone Vite app
•   with ArgoCD API proxy pre-configured.
• Verification: node --test src/argoCdParser.test.js → 35/35 pass

✨ feat(frontend): add visual drag-and-drop topology configurator
• - Add frontend/configurator module (React 18 + TypeScript + Vite)
• - topology_builder/types.ts: AZ, WorkerNode, PlacedStellarNode, TopologyState,
•   ValidationResult, DragPayload type definitions
• - topology_builder/topology_store.ts: React context + useReducer store with 12
•   action types; createInitialState() seeds 3-zone us-east layout
• - topology_builder/quorum_validator.ts: validateTopology() with 4 errors
•   (INSUFFICIENT_ZONES, ZONE_MISSING_VALIDATOR, QUORUM_BELOW_THRESHOLD,
•   SINGLE_ZONE_VALIDATORS) and 4 warnings (UNEVEN_DISTRIBUTION,
•   NO_HISTORY_ARCHIVE, MISSING_QUORUM_SET, SEED_SECRET_MISSING)
• - WorkerNode.tsx: draggable worker node tile with HTML5 native DnD
• - AvailabilityZone.tsx: drop-zone container with drag-over glow and
•   per-zone validation messages
• - StellarNodePlacer.tsx: node-type palette with inline config form
• - TopologyBuilder.tsx: main orchestrator with live validation badge and
•   manifest modal with clipboard copy
• - frontend/utils/manifest_builder.ts: generates valid stellar.org/v1alpha1
•   StellarNode YAML + PodDisruptionBudget using pure template literals
• - 43 tests passing (21 quorum_validator + 22 manifest_validation)
• - TypeScript strict mode with zero errors
• Add topology visualizer workspace
✨ feat(contracts): add Decentralized Staking & Yield Distribution Engine (#73)
• Implements the Synthetix/Uniswap StakingRewards accumulator model for
• Soroban smart contracts as described in issue #73.
• ## Key modules
• - contracts/staking-vault/src/lib.rs — contract entry-points:
•   initialize, deposit, withdraw, claim_reward, compound,
•   emergency_withdraw, set_paused, and view functions.
• - contracts/staking-vault/src/reward.rs — pure reward math:
•   compute_reward_per_token, compute_earned, compute_new_reward_rate.
• ## Algorithm
• Reward tracking uses the standard per-token accumulator:
•   reward_per_token += (Δt × rate × PRECISION) / total_staked
•   user_earned      += stake × (rpt_now - rpt_paid) / PRECISION
• REWARD_PRECISION = 1e18 eliminates precision loss for small stake
• weights or short block durations, satisfying the zero-rounding-drift
• requirement in the issue.
• ## Features
• - Continuous reward accrual with REWARD_PRECISION = 1e18
• - Deposit / Withdraw with automatic reward checkpoint on every call
• - Claim rewards at any time
• - Compound rewards back into stake (same-token pools)
• - Emergency Withdraw — bypasses reward math when contract is paused,
•   guaranteeing capital recovery
• - Admin pause / unpause
• ## Tests (13/13 pass)
• - Proportional reward distribution across multiple stakers
• - Reward caps at period_finish (no accrual after deadline)
• - Balance solvency invariant: no staker earns more than total emitted
• - Zero-stake earns zero
• - Stored rewards accumulate correctly across checkpoints
• - Rounding no-drift: 100 incremental checkpoints == single computation
• - New reward rate rollover when period is still active
• Closes #73
• Implement flamegraph and DR Command Center dashboard
📝 ci: validate exported PrometheusRule YAML with promtool (#52)
• Adds a dedicated workflow that runs on changes under frontend/builder/:
• - npm test (29 unit tests: PromQL generator + YAML exporter)
• - npm run build (verifies React/JSX correctness)
• - Generates 5 complex sample alert conditions via the real
•   yamlExporter.js code path (multi-comparison AND/OR, increase()
•   on counters, various severities)
• - Validates all 5 against promtool check rules
• Satisfies the ticket's validation requirement without needing
• promtool installed locally.
✨ feat(alerts): fix PromQL preview wrap, default threshold, and hardened Prometheus test error handling
• - promql-preview now wraps long expressions instead of horizontal-scrolling
• - Default comparison threshold changed from 0 to 3, matching the real
•   fork-detector-alerts.yaml convention, so first-time users see a
•   realistic example
• - Test against Prometheus button now checks response content-type
•   before parsing JSON, producing a clear 'could not reach Prometheus'
•   message instead of a raw parse exception when no instance is running
✨ feat(frontend): add multi-cluster comparison dashboard
🐛 fix: remove invalid panic/lto keys from package-level profile override
• Cargo rejects panic and lto in [profile.release.package.*] overrides —
• only opt-level, codegen-units, debug, debug-assertions, overflow-checks,
• and strip are valid there. This was blocking cargo build entirely.
• Unrelated to #52; found while setting up the alert rule builder.
✨ feat(contracts): add Soroban TTL auto-bump maintenance contract
• Implements the ttl-bumper Soroban contract for automated keeper-bot TTL
• maintenance of Stellar contract storage entries.
• Key modules:
• - contracts/ttl-bumper/src/lib.rs  – main contract (initialize, register,
•   deregister, bump_batch, bounty deposit/withdraw, view helpers)
• - contracts/ttl-bumper/src/registry.rs – persistent registry of
•   (contract_id, threshold, extension, owner) entries; DataKey enum,
•   RegistryEntry struct, and all CRUD helpers
• - contracts/ttl-bumper/src/test.rs – 32 integration tests covering the
•   full keeper workflow, key-aging simulation, bounty exhaustion safety,
•   registry capacity limits, and auth guards
• Contract features:
• - Registry tracks up to 256 contract keys requiring periodic TTL bumping
• - bump_batch() extends up to 50 entries in a single transaction
• - Keeper bots receive XLM bounties only for keys actually bumped
• - Bounty pool cannot be exhausted below zero; bumps succeed even when
•   the pool is empty (fail-open for TTL extension, fail-safe for bounties)
• - Admin-only bounty pool management (deposit, withdraw, set_bounty)
• - Per-entry auth: only the registered owner or admin can deregister
• Workspace: added contracts/ttl-bumper as a workspace member in Cargo.toml.
• All 32 tests pass; cargo build succeeds.

✨ feat(frontend): real-time resource saturation heatmap for worker nodes
• Implements issue #10 - React/D3 heatmap component visualising CPU and
• Memory saturation across up to 100 Kubernetes worker nodes.
• New files:
• - frontend/analytics/src/heatmapModel.js
•   Pure data model: parses Prometheus API responses, merges cpu/memory
•   samples per node, tombstones disappeared nodes, classifies into five
•   saturation bands (idle/moderate/elevated/high/critical).
• - frontend/analytics/src/heatmapModel.test.js
•   31 unit tests (23 new for heatmap model, all passing).
• - frontend/analytics/src/components/heatmap/HeatmapGrid.jsx
•   Main component. D3 manages SVG DOM directly (enter/update/exit) to
•   avoid VDOM diffing overhead on 100-node 5-second ticks. CSS transitions
•   animate color changes between polls without blocking the JS thread.
•   ResizeObserver recalculates column count on container resize.
•   Accessible: role=grid, role=gridcell, aria-label, keyboard focus/tooltip.
• - frontend/analytics/src/components/heatmap/HeatmapTooltip.jsx
•   Portal-based tooltip with CPU%, Memory%, saturation band, zone, and
•   offline badge. Keyboard-accessible (Enter/Space on focused cell).
• - frontend/analytics/src/components/heatmap/usePrometheusPoller.js
•   Polling hook: fetches stellar_operator_resource_usage at 5 s intervals,
•   surfaces status (idle/polling/error/offline) and lastPollAt timestamp.
• - frontend/analytics/scripts/mock-prometheus.mjs
•   Mock Prometheus HTTP server simulating 100 worker nodes across three
•   availability zones with a rolling CPU spike wave (configurable window
•   and interval). Responds to GET /api/v1/query in Prometheus vector format.
• Modified files:
• - frontend/analytics/src/main.jsx
•   Adds Topology / Heatmap tab switcher in the app shell toolbar.
•   HeatmapGrid rendered on the Heatmap tab, WS connection only opened
•   when the Topology tab is active.
• - frontend/analytics/src/styles.css
•   Heatmap-specific styles: grid wrap, summary strip, legend swatches,
•   portal tooltip, view-tab active state, responsive breakpoints.
• - frontend/analytics/package.json
•   Adds d3@7.9.0 dependency and mock:prometheus npm script.
• - frontend/analytics/vite.config.js
•   Adds /api/prometheus proxy pointing at mock server (localhost:9091).
• Closes #10
✨ feat(telemetry): add PromQL metrics exporter for Soroban gas profiling
• - New stellar-telemetry crate with async log parser and Prometheus exporter
• - Zero-copy JSON parser using string slicing for minimal heap allocations
• - Histograms for soroban_contract_cpu_instructions and soroban_contract_memory_bytes
• - /metrics HTTP endpoint with labeled histogram and counter vectors
• - Async streaming parser via parse_log_stream() with StreamStats
• - Criterion benchmarks for parser throughput validation
• - Unit tests for parser correctness and exporter text format

✨ feat(security): Soroban reentrancy guard middleware
✨ feat(security): add Soroban reentrancy guard middleware
• Implements a native reentrancy guard sub-contract middleware under
• wasm-plugins/security/reentrancy/, enforced through the Stellar-K8s custom
• validation (Wasm) layer (issue #8).
• - Storage-agnostic write-lock stack core that reverts nested, mutating
•   cross-contract re-entries of the same state variable while producing zero
•   false positives on non-mutating read callbacks.
• - ConfigMap-driven per-namespace / per-contract-ID scoping with a safe
•   "enabled everywhere" default and explicit opt-outs.
• - Optional 'soroban' feature binds the core to Soroban host instance storage
•   and compiles to a no_std (alloc) wasm32-unknown-unknown guest that ships a
•   minimal global allocator; overhead stays < 500 instructions (MAX_DEPTH=8).
• - Deliberately vulnerable mock vault plus a 19-unit/7-integration security
•   suite proving the exploit and its prevention.
• - ADR 0005 documenting the locking mechanism, plus deployable ConfigMap
•   example.
